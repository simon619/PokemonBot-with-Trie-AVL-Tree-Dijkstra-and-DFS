I love playing **Pokemon Go**. So, I developed this Bot to help me playing the game on the outside.


# Search Command
-------------------------------------------------
The **Search Command** works as a search engine of the system. **!seach [arg]** will bring all the searched Pokemon infomation on the discord output interface. If the argument does match with any name of the Pokemons that are stored in the data structure, the bot starts to match prefix of name of Pokemons with the gives argument. Later it shows the names of the Pokemons that matched with the prefix. If even the prefix does not match, the Bot simply shows **No Result Found** message.
